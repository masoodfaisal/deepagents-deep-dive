"""Audio-device and notebook-UI plumbing for the Gemini Live voice notebook.

The teaching code (Live session config, tool declaration, the send/receive loop)
lives in the notebook. This module holds the boilerplate around it: bridging
PortAudio's callback threads to asyncio at the sample rates the Live API expects,
the widgets that show captions and deep-agent activity, and the task juggling that
ends a session cleanly.

    Gemini Live: microphone input is 16 kHz PCM, model audio output is 24 kHz PCM,
    both mono, signed 16-bit little-endian.
